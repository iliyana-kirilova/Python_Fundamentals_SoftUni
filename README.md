# 🐍 SoftUni Fundamentals – Python Practice

Welcome to my personal repository where I solve programming tasks from the **SoftUni Programming Fundamentals** course – using **Python** and learning the theory **on my own**.

This is my space to **practice**, **experiment**, and **track my progress** while studying independently.

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This
Although I’m currently following the **Java path** at SoftUni, I’ve chosen to solve these tasks in **Python** to strengthen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of programming concepts.
Solving these problems helps me:

- 🧠 Understand core programming concepts deeply  
- 💪 Build problem-solving skills  
- 🚀 Prepare for more advanced topics and real projects
